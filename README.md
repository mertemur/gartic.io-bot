# gartic.io-bot
 Self-drawing in-game bot for gartic.io
 This project's purpose is not to create a cheat-bot or an evil 3rd party program. It's all about learning and practicing.
 
# Dependencies

# How-to-use
 After fulfilling all the mentioned requirements, you just need to open gartic.io on fullscreen at the first tab. When it's your turn to draw, you can run the code and it should do the trick.
 There can be mistakes or necessary improvements. I'm open to ideas.
